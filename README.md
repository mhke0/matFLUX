# matFLUX 0.9

**matFLUX** is a MATLAB-based application designed for the analysis of isotropic **3D MINFLUX localization microscopy** data.  
It provides tools for clustering, multi-channel alignment, radial distribution, and precision analysis of nanoscale structures in a user-friendly GUI.

## 📦 Installation

### Option 1: Standalone App (No MATLAB Required)

1. Download the standalone installer for your OS (Mac/Windows/Linux).
2. Follow the instructions to install MATLAB Runtime (R2020a or newer).
3. Launch matFLUX from the installed app.

### Option 2: MATLAB App (.mlapp)

Requirements:

- MATLAB R2018b or later
- Toolboxes:
  - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
  - Image Processing Toolbox

Usage:

1. Launch `matFLUX.mlappinstall`.
2. Run 'matFLUX.mlapp' inside MATLAB.
3. Click **Run** to start the app.

## ⚙️ Python Dependency (Alignment Feature)

If you want to use automatic alignment based on bead data:

- Install Python 3.x and ensure it's on your system PATH.
- Required script: `resources/zarr_extract.py`
- Bead data must be exported in ZARR format from the Abberior MINFLUX system.
- If not directly detected, you can link the zarr script from within the app.

## 📁 File Formats

- Input: `.mat` files exported from Abberior MINFLUX software
- Output: `.mat`, `.tif`, `.png`, `.pdf`

## 📖 Documentation

The full user tutorial is available in the app under the **Help** menu or as a standalone PDF in `/docs/matFLUX_Tutorial.pdf`.
